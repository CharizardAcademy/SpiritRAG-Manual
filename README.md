# Welcome

This guide provides an overview of SpiritRAG, a question-answering system designed to support knowledge exploration in the domains of religion and spirituality.

Developed at the University of Zurich by a team of four postdoctoral researchers with expertise in computer science, medical anthropology, computational linguistics, and educational science, SpiritRAG represents an interdisciplinary effort to build a customizable and scalable tool for digital-humanities research.

SpiritRAG enables domain-aware and context-sensitive information retrieval grounded in data provided by the user. SpiritRAG currently draws on a dataset drawn from the official archive of the United Nations General Assembly.

In the following pages, you will find our research motivation, system architecture, implementation details, and an overview of the current features.
