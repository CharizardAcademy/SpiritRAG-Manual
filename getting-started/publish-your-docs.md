# Motivation

SpiritRAG was created to address a fundamental challenge in the study of religion and spirituality: knowledge in this domain is deeply shaped by context. Concepts such as _spiritual care_, _ritual practice_, or _well-being_ can carry different meanings depending on whether they appear in clinical care, education, social policy, anthropology, or other fields. Conventional question-answering systems often fail to capture these nuances because they treat queries as if they were independent of cultural, disciplinary, and situational backgrounds.

Our motivation was to build a system that respects this complexity. SpiritRAG grounds language generation in domain-sensitive information retrieval, ensuring that answers remain aligned with the specific traditions, practices, and scholarly interpretations relevant to the user’s query. By combining retrieval with large language models, it allows for precise, context-aware knowledge acquisition rather than generic or decontextualized responses.

The project emerged from an interdisciplinary collaboration across computer science, clinical anthropology, computational linguistics, and education science. Each discipline contributed essential perspectives on how spirituality is lived, understood, and studied. This diversity helped shape a system capable of supporting researchers, clinicians, educators, and practitioners who rely on specialized and culturally rooted knowledge.

Ultimately, SpiritRAG aims to offer a scalable and customizable tool for digital-humanities research, enabling users to explore spiritual knowledge in a way that is rigorous, contextual, and sensitive to human experience.

Understanding these domain-specific contexts is essential for accurate and meaningful knowledge acquisition.</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

SpiritRAG is the result of a truly interdisciplinary collaboration at the University of Zurich. Our team brings together four postdoctoral researchers whose expertise spans several academic traditions:

* **Linguistic Research Infrastructure** (Dr. Yingqiang Gao\*), contributing insights into project implementation, including corpus construction, system architecting, platform deployment and maintanence, and&#x20;
* **Department of Theology** (Dr. Fabian Winiger\*), offering deep domain knowledge on religion, spirituality, and their cultural and historical expressions
* **Department of Computational Linguistics** (Dr. Anastasia Shaitarova), providing technical leadership in information retrieval, large language models, and system design
* **Institute of Education** (Dr. Patrick Montjourides), enriching the project with perspectives on learning, equity, and the role of context in human understanding

Together, we integrate these complementary strengths to build a system that reflects the multifaceted nature of spiritual knowledge and supports rigorous, context-aware inquiry across disciplines.
