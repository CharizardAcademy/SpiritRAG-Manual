# Data

Policymakers often face considerable obstacles when working with concepts that are highly contextual and domain-dependent. Terms related to religion and spirituality are particularly difficult, as they are rarely used, and often in irrelevant contexts. This problem is well demonstrated by the [official archive of the United Nations General Assembly.](https://research.un.org/en/docs/ga/or)

The official UN archives contain an extensive collection of resolutions, reports, and policy texts issued by bodies such as the Security Council, General Assembly, and ECOSOC, but they are dispersed across outdated or fragmented search interfaces. Additional organizations within the UN system, including WHO and UNESCO, maintain their own independent archives, further complicating navigation.

SpiritRAG is built on the top of 7,500+ UN resolution documents, parallel in all six UN official languages plus German.</strong> </p></figcaption></figure>

For researchers and practitioners interested in nuanced topics such as religion and spirituality, this search interface is barely usable. Queries often return large volumes of irrelevant texts filled with procedural formalities, boilerplate language, and repeated phrases that match keywords but not meaning. Extracting actionable insights frequently requires time-consuming manual review of thousands of documents.

We used UN resolution documents as the foundation for SpiritRAG because they represent one of the most authoritative, globally negotiated sources of policy language in areas where spirituality, human well-being, and social development intersect. At the same time, these documents exemplify the practical challenges faced by scholars and policymakers: they are rich in content but difficult to search, interpret, and contextualize.

SpiritRAG currently draws on a corpus of 7,500 documents retrieved from the official archive of the United Nations General Assembly matching the following criteria:

1. resolution documents (marked RES);&#x20;
2. related to the subjects health and education;
3. published between 01.01.1990 and 03.31.2025.
