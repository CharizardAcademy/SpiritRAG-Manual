# Motivation

SpiritRAG was created to address a fundamental challenge in the study of religion and spirituality: knowledge in this domain is deeply shaped by context. Concepts such as _spiritual care_, _ritual practice_, or _well-being_ can carry different meanings depending on whether they appear in clinical care, education, social policy, anthropology, or other fields. Conventional question-answering systems often fail to capture these nuances because they treat queries as if they were independent of cultural, disciplinary, and situational backgrounds.

Our motivation was to build a system that respects this complexity. SpiritRAG grounds language generation in domain-sensitive information retrieval, ensuring that answers remain aligned with the specific traditions, practices, and scholarly interpretations relevant to the user’s query. By combining retrieval with large language models, it allows for precise, context-aware knowledge acquisition rather than generic or decontextualized responses.

The project emerged from an interdisciplinary collaboration across computer science, clinical anthropology, computational linguistics, and education science. Each discipline contributed essential perspectives on how spirituality is lived, understood, and studied. This diversity helped shape a system capable of supporting researchers, clinicians, educators, and practitioners who rely on specialized and culturally rooted knowledge.

Ultimately, SpiritRAG aims to offer a scalable and customizable tool for digital-humanities research, enabling users to explore spiritual knowledge in a way that is rigorous, contextual, and sensitive to human experience.

Understanding these domain-specific contexts is essential for accurate and meaningful knowledge acquisition.</strong></p></figcaption></figure>

SpiritRAG is the result of a truly interdisciplinary collaboration at the University of Zurich. Our team brings together four postdoctoral researchers whose expertise spans several academic traditions:

* **Linguistic Research Infrastructure** (Dr. Yingqiang Gao\*), leading the technical implementation of the project, including corpus construction, system architecture, platform deployment and maintenance, and comprehensive system testing.
* **Department of Theology** (Dr. Fabian Winiger\*), contributing deep expertise in religion and spirituality, offering contextual understanding of their cultural, historical, and interpretive evaluation dimensions.
* **Department of Computational Linguistics** (Dr. Anastasia Shaitarova), providing expertise in corpus analysis, data visualization, linguistic insights, and the development of illustrative case studies.
* **Institute of Education** (Dr. Patrick Montjourides), bringsing perspectives on policy, international frameworks, and the role of social and institutional context in education and health.

Together, SpiritRAG integrates these complementary strengths to build a system that reflects the multifaceted nature of spiritual knowledge and supports rigorous, context-aware inquiry across disciplines.
