You can ask SpiritRAG any question related to religion and spirituality in the context of health and education, and it will generate an answer grounded in the source documents (see [Data](data.md)).

* Click the folder icon in the lower‑right corner to view the **list of source documents** used to generate the answer. An extra toggle is also provided for **evaluation** purposes.
* Select any of the available language options to **open the corresponding PDF** directly in the left‑hand pane.
* **Filter documents** by year and subject using combinatory logics:
  * refugees, right to education -> filters documents that contain both subjects
  * refugees | right to education -> filters  documents that contain at least one subject
  * refugees, right to education -> filters documents that contain right to education but not refugees&#x20;
* Toggle **dark mode**
